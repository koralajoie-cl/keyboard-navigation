# keyboard-navigation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the principles of keyboard navigation and accessibility in web development. The site includes examples of both good and bad practices, providing an interactive learning experience for developers aiming to improve accessibility in their applications.

By understanding these concepts, developers can start to create user-friendly interfaces that are accessible to everyone, including users who rely on keyboards.

## Purpose

The Keyboard Navigation Demo is designed to:

Educate Developers: Show how different approaches to navigation and interactivity impact accessibility.
- Showcase how different approaches to navigation and interactivity impact accessibility.
- Highlight bad practices, such as relying solely on hover events or using elements without appropriate interactivity.
- Demonstrate good practices, including focus management, and semantic HTML

Provide Hands-On Experience: 
- Allow users to test keyboard navigation directly on the site, reinforcing their understanding of best practices.

## How to Use the Demo
### Navigate the Site:
**Tab**: Move between interactive elements (menu items, form fields, and buttons).
**Shift + Tab**: Navigate backward through the elements.
**Enter**: Interact with elements, such as buttons or links.
**Spacebar and Arrow Keys**: Interact with dropdowns and select elements.

### Experiment with the good and bad:
- Compare the usability of the bad examples (e.g., hover-only interactions) with the good examples (keyboard and focus-friendly components).
